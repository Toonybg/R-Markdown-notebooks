This is my first project on linerar regression.

# Title - Linear regression#


## second title - Introduction ##

First I will reuse the content from my school project then I will build on top of it.

```{r}
2+2

```
First I will load the data file for building the model
```{r}
remove(chenille)
caterpillar=read.table(file="caterpillar.txt",header=T,dec=".")
plot(caterpillar)
cor(caterpillar)


```
here sould learn:
 - what is correlation
 - what is correlation between multiple variables 
 
 
 
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 
```{r}
#here we build a data model lm -- linear model
reslm <- lm(Y~X1+ X2 + X3 + X4 + X5 + X6 + X7 + X8 + X9 + X10 ,caterpillar)
library(car)
round(vif(reslm),2)
```








Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
